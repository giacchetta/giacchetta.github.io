## Basic
To kick things off, let's clear up some potential confusion for those who are new to this.

> GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.
Continuous integration (CI) is a software practice that requires frequently committing code to a shared repository. Thus, you can continuously build and test the code to make sure that the commit doesn't introduce errors.
On the other hand, Continuous deployment (CD) is the practice of using automation to publish and deploy software updates to your servers.

Just a quick heads-up about GitHub Actions â€“ this is to make sure we're all on the same page. Now, let's dive into some stuff you won't find in the official docs, which, by the way, are super detailed and can be found at [Github Actions Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
